# Program Details

The entire VisInPractice program is dedicated to everyone interested in the **practical aspects of data visualization and visual analytics**. The focus will be on how to solve real use cases rather than discussing them from the more abstract, academic perspective. The program targets both newcomers to visualization and visual analysis as well as returning members of the community seeking to learn about new tools and practices.

## VisInPractice Talk Series

In the morning, invited practitioners will share their experiences from their visualization projects, focusing on the "how" rather than the "what". Each talk will be approximately 30 minutes in length.

## VisInPractice: The Tools of the Trade

The early afternoon session will focus on the question of what is possible with established visualization and visual analytics tools.

## Mini-Symposium on Visualizing Uncertainty in Practice

In the late afternoon, we will coordinate a fast-paced session that brings participants up to speed with the practical aspects of uncertainty visualization. To this end, we will begin this session with a **30-minute primer** by [Kristi Potter](https://www.nrel.gov/research/kristi-potter.html) of the National Renwewable Energy Laboratory on the topic that specifically highlights challenges and established approaches. Following this primer will be a set of **six 10-minute lightning talks**, each of which outlines a working solution from a practical setting.
