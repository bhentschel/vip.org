# Program: Monday, October 22, 2018 (9am - 6pm)

The entire VisInPractice program is dedicated to everyone interested in the **practical aspects of data visualization and visual analytics**. The focus will be on how to solve real use cases rather than discussing them from the more abstract, academic perspective. The program targets both newcomers to visualization and visual analysis as well as returning members of the community seeking to learn about new tools and practices.

In the months leading up to the event, we will be updating this program with a detailed schedule indicating the order and times of the talks. **Click on a speaker to see their talk title, abstract, and bio**:

## glue-ing together the Universe
<img src="../assets/goodman.png" width="100%" title="Alyssa Goodman: glue-ing together the Universe"  alt="Alyssa Goodman: glue-ing together the Universe"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Alyssa Goodman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~agoodman/), Harvard University, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and the Smithsonian Institution

**ABSTRACT**: Astronomers have a long history of visualization. Going back only as far as Galileo, discoveries were made using sketches of celestial objects moving over time. Today, Astronomy inquiries can, and often do, make use of petabytes of data at once. Huge surveys are analyzed statistically to understand tiny fluctuations that hint at the fundamental nature of the Universe, and myriad data sets, from telescopes across the globe and in space are brought together to solve problems ranging from the nature of black holes to the structure of the Milky Way to the origins of planets like Earth. In this talk, I will summarize the state of partnerships between astronomical, physical, and computational approaches to gleaning insight from combinations of scientific and information visualization in Astrophysics. In particular, I will discuss how the “glue” linked-view visualization environment ([glueviz.org](http://glueviz.org)), developed originally to facilitate high-dimensional data exploration in Astronomy and Medicine, can be extended to many other fields of data-driven inquiry. In addition, I will explain how the current open-source, plug & play, approach to software facilitates the combination of powerful programs and projects such as glue, WorldWide Telescope, ESASky, and the Zooniverse Citizen Science platform.   Throughout the talk, I will emphasize the commonalities amongst many fields of science that rely on high-dimensional data.  Scientists do not draw distinctions between “scientific visualizations” that show literal spatial dimensions, and “information visualizations” that characterize non-spatial and/or statistical aspects of data.  My goal will be to leave Vis attendees with an appreciation of the powerful discovery opportunities offered to scientists when visualization types developed by the InfoVis, SciVis, and VAST communities can be connected in the kind of flexible, linked-view high-dimensional visualization  environment offered by glue.

**SPEAKER BIO**: [Alyssa Goodman](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~agoodman/) is the Robert Wheeler Willson Professor of Applied Astronomy at Harvard University, coDirector for Science at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, and a Research Associate of the Smithsonian Institution.

## Transparent Machine Learning with Visual Analytics: How Interactive Visualization can Support Practitioners in the Machine Learning Process
<img src="../assets/bernard.png" width="100%" title="Jürgen Bernard: Transparent Machine Learning with Visual Analytics"  alt="Jürgen Bernard: Transparent Machine Learning with Visual Analytics"/>
**SPEAKER**: Jürgen Bernard, TU Darmstadt

**ABSTRACT**: Machine Learning is a key technology in the era of data-centered applications. Effective Machine Learning models have been trained in the past, that ease our everyday life or gain other types of promising benefits. Today, in many cases humans still do not fully understand how these models have been trained, why these models predict a particular output for a given input instance, or whether predictions of these models always reflect humans’ notion of judgement in a meaningful way. This talk addresses two remaining challenges of many practitioners to a) understand the output of Machine Learning models and b) play a more active role in the Machine Learning process. I will demonstrate that Visual Analytics is a promising approach to address these challenges. The overall principle is to combine meaningful visualization and interaction designs with automated data analysis and learning-support techniques. My application examples will focus on the data-labeling problem. Machine Learning models require information (labels) about instances before they can be trained – providing those labels is often a tedious, unsatisfactory process for human labelers. "Visual-Interactive Labeling (VIAL)" includes the class of Visual Analytics approaches that make the data labeling and Machine Learning process a visual-interactive experience – for experts and non-experts. With VIAL, users have visual-interactive means to a) assign labels to data, b) participate in the iterative Machine Learning process, and c) validate the output of Machine Learning models.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Jürgen Bernard is Post-doc at TU Darmstadt, Germany. He was with Fraunhofer IGD when he received is PhD degree in 2015. His research is in information visualization and visual analytics with an emphasis on medical health care and other applications requiring data-driven research. His data-centered focus is on time-oriented data and high-dimensional data. Many of his visual-interactive solutions combine techniques from cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, similarity search, active learning, or other machine learning techniques.

<img src="../assets/mcgovern_inceoglu.png" width="100%" title="Ayhan Inceoglu and Luke Mc Govern: Siemens Power Generation – Big Data Analysis Old World vs. New World"  alt="Ayhan Inceoglu and Luke Mc Govern: Siemens Power Generation – Big Data Analysis Old World vs. New World"/>
**SPEAKER**: Ayhan Inceoglu and Luke Mc Govern, Siemens

**ABSTRACT**: The presentation from Ayhan Inceoglu and Luke Mc Govern from Siemens AG will be in two parts. In part one Ayhan will give a brief overview of our business and the workings of a gas turbine. He will then bring up a case study from 2005 about a fleet issue and how it was solved through expert analysis and some intuition. In part two Luke will explain discuss how the Power Generation division within Siemens has advanced in the area of data analytics and big data in the last years. Such as increased usage of tools such as Tableau and QLik along with a more integrated data and information landscape. He will then show how the case study from before might have been solved more quickly thanks to the interconnected data. Visualizations of large diverse data sets together with machine learning can help to find solutions to all manner of problems.
But expert knowledge is still required to separate correlation and causation.

**SPEAKER BIOS**: Luke Mc Govern completed his studies in Ireland in 2006 and moved to Berlin in 2008 where he started working for Siemens AG. Between 2008 and 2013 he processed data and generated statistical reports the operation and maintenance gas turbine fleet.

## Xenographics: Why we should all be William Playfairs
<img src="../assets/lambrechts.png" width="100%" title="Maarten Lambrechts: Xenographics: Why we should all be William Playfairs"  alt="Maarten Lambrechts: Xenographics: Why we should all be William Playfairs"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Maarten Lambrechts](http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/), consultant

**ABSTRACT**: Data sets people work with today are bigger and more complex then ever. Visualising this data requires new visualisation techniques and chart types, but the adoption of these is a very slow process. To help the dissemination of new techniques in visualisation, Maarten started xeno.graphics, a collection of less common and innovative visualisations. While collecting the examples, Maarten gathered some insights about these "weird charts".

In his talk, Maarten will share many of the xenographics to illustrate these insights. Drawing parallels with William Playfair and his work, he will discuss conventions in visualisation, conservatism in visualisation, chart type names, killing bad ideas and the research-practice gap.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Maarten is a data journalist and visualisation consultant. A tortuous carreer path brought him from graduating as a bio-engineer in forestry and nature conservation to working as a data journalist at Belgian newspaper De Tijd. He is now working as a freelancer: he designs and develops visualisations, helps to build visualisation tools and gives trainings and workshops.

## Visualizing large-scale geolocation data with kepler.gl
<img src="../assets/he.png" width="100%" title="Shan He: Visualizing large-scale geolocation data with kepler.gl"  alt="Shan He: Visualizing large-scale geolocation data with kepler.gl"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Shan He](http://shanhe.io/), Uber

**ABSTRACT**: [Kepler.gl](http://kepler.gl) is a data-agnostic, high-performance web-based application for visual exploration of large-scale geolocation datasets. Built on top of deck.gl, kepler.gl can render millions of points representing thousands of trips and perform spatial aggregations on the fly.

Kepler.gl is built for users with a variety of experience and skill levels to navigate the vast amount of geospatial data and create meaningful data visualizations. Showing geospatial data in a single web interface, kepler.gl helps users quickly validate ideas and glean insights from these visualizations. Using kepler.gl, a user can drag and drop a CSV or GeoJSON file into the browser, visualize it with different map layers, explore it by filtering and aggregating it, and eventually export the final visualization as a static map or an animated video. Instead of spanning multiple browsers and consuming weeks of work at a time, the entire trial and error process occurs place in one user interface and can take as little as 10 minutes!

Not only a powerful geo-visualization application, kepler.gl is also a framework built with React and Redux to be embedded into other application as map components. This talk will introduce the idea behind kepler.gl, why and how did we build it. For researchers in various domains, I will demonstrate how to quickly prototype and verify new research ideas for geo temporal spatial data at scale.  For developers who build domain-specific tools, this is also an end-to-end story on how to build such web-based authoring/workflow tool with task-oriented justifications.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Shan is a senior data visualization engineer at Uber. She is a coder, a designer, and a data artist. Shan is the founding member of Uber's data visualization team. At Uber, she builds data tools and platforms to make business intelligence easy to access, creates exploratory data visualizations to facilitate data analysis and modeling, and publishes public facing graphics and animations to tell data stories about Uber. Prior to joining Uber, Shan studied at MIT and received a master in design computation while conducting research at the MIT Senseable City Lab as data visualization specialist. Shan is the author of kepler.gl, an open sourced data visualization tool, for visualizing large-scale geospatial data on the web.

<img src="../assets/tulp.png" width="100%" title="Jan Willem Tulp: What I Learned Creating a 3D Visualization with 60K+ Datapoints in the Browser"  alt="Jan Willem Tulp: What I Learned Creating a 3D Visualization with 60K+ Datapoints in the Browser"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Jan Willem Tulp](http://tulpinteractive.com/), Tulp Interactive

**ABSTRACT**: Creating 3D visualizations using WebGL in the browser requires some other strategies than for instance creating 2D SVG visualizations with D3. Using several projects as examples, I will explain some of the technical and design choices that I've made. For instance, what parts are run in shaders, and what parts are not? Or, how to achieve crisp looking texts? And, when combining with D3, what parts are made in D3 and what parts in WebGL, and why?

**SPEAKER BIO**: Jan Willem Tulp is a independent Data Experience Designer from The Netherlands. With his company TULP interactive he creates custom data visualizations for a variety of clients. For more than 6 years he has helped clients such as Google, the European Space Agency, Scientific American, Nature, and the World Economic Forum by creating visualizations, both interactive and in print. His work has appeared in several books and magazines and he speaks regularly at international conferences.

# VisInPractice: The Tools of the Trade

The early afternoon session will focus on the question of what is possible with established visualization and visual analytics tools.
<span id="rost" class="anchor"></span>
## Data Vis Tools, Revisited
<img src="../assets/rost.png" width="100%" title="Lisa Charlotte Rost: Data Vis Tools, Revisited"  alt="Lisa Charlotte Rost: Data Vis Tools, Revisited"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Lisa Charlotte Rost](https://lisacharlotterost.de/), Datawrapper

**ABSTRACT**: Two years ago, I tried to recreate the same chart with 24 different data vis tools: 12 apps (like Plotly, Adobe Illustrator or RAW) and 12 programming languages/frameworks (like d3.js, Vega-Lite, ggplot2 or Matplotlib). I then wrote a blog post summing up what I learned thanks to this experiment. In my talk, I want to revisit my insights from back then. What do I see differently now? Which new tools have entered the pool? Which ones died a silent death? Which ones have improved the most in the last two years? And since tools are supposed to make it easier to visualize data: Has it become easier, actually? If I do a good job, you'll get an overview of the landscape of data vis tools and some new ideas how to think about them. And you'll learn what to tell the strangers who email you and ask which data vis tools they should start to learn.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Lisa Charlotte Rost is a designer at Datawrapper, who's been writing and talking about data vis for a few years. In 2016 Lisa was an OpenNews Fellow at NPR in Washington, DC. Before that, she created data visualizations for newsrooms like Tagesspiegel, Bloomberg, SPIEGEL & ZEIT Online. Based in Berlin now, she organizes the Data Vis meetup and spends way too much time on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lisacrost).

## State-of-the-art of Commercial Visual Analytics Systems
<img src="../assets/behrisch.png" width="100%" title="Michael Behrisch: State-of-the-art of Commercial Visual Analytics Systems"  alt="Michael Behrisch: State-of-the-art of Commercial Visual Analytics Systems"/>
**SPEAKER**: [Michael Behrisch](http://michael.behrisch.info), Harvard University

**ABSTRACT**: Commercial Visual Analytics systems are becoming omnipresent in our data analysis life. However, the challenging question for business and academic users is "Which tool should be used in the data analysis scenario at hand?" Five years after the first state-of-the-art report on Commercial Visual Analytics Systems we present a reevaluation of the Big Data Analytics field. We build on the success of the 2012 survey, which was influential even beyond the boundaries of the InfoVis and Visual Analytics (VA) community. We assess new product versions on established evaluation criteria, such as available features, performance, and usability, to extend on and assure comparability with the previous survey. We also investigate previously unavailable products to paint a more complete picture of the commercial VA landscape and introduce novel measures, like suitability for specific user groups. We explore the achievements in the commercial sector in addressing VA challenges and propose novel developments that should be on systems’ roadmaps in the coming years. The goal of this talk will be to give an understanding how the systems' feature sets, approaches and developments can be comparatively evaluated. With this tool set you will be better prepared in the decision which commercial visual analytics system to choose for your real-world analysis scenarios.

**SPEAKER BIO**: Dr. Michael Behrisch is a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Visual Computing Group at the Harvard University Cambridge, USA since 2017. 
His research interest include the visualization of relational data, pattern analysis in visualizations, and user-centric exploration approaches for large data spaces. 
He received his PhD. in Computer Science from the University of Konstanz, where he worked from 2011 until 2017 as a Research Associate in the Data Analysis and Visualization Group.
