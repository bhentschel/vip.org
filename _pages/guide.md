# The VIS 2018 Practitioner Guide

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

This guide presents a high-level guide to some of the most interesting [technical sessions of the IEEE VIS 2018 conference](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/papers-sessions), with a particular emphasis on sessions that are of relevance to practitioners. For a complete list of conference sessions and the full conference program, please refere to [ieeevis.org](http://ieeevis.org/) and their [at-a-glance-schedule](http://ieeevis.org/attachments/VIS2018_AAG.pdf).

When preparing the practitioner guide, we incorporated the titles and abstracts of content appearing at this year's conference as well as statements elicited from paper authors. In this way, we identified six practitioner interest groups, which also appear now throughout the VIS PDF and print program available at [ieeevis.org](http://ieeevis.org/):
