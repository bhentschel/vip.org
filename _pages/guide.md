# The VIS 2018 Practitioner Guide

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

This guide presents a high-level guide to some of the most interesting [technical sessions of the IEEE VIS 2018 conference](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/papers-sessions), with a particular emphasis on sessions that are of relevance to practitioners. For a complete list of conference sessions and the full conference program, please refere to [ieeevis.org](http://ieeevis.org/) and their [at-a-glance-schedule](http://ieeevis.org/attachments/VIS2018_AAG.pdf).

Last year at [IEEE VIS 2017](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/overview-amp-topics/practitioner-guide/pg), we prepared a practitioner guide for 4 groups of practitioners as well as a guide for all practitioners. This year, we incorporated the titles and abstracts of content appearing at this year's conference as well as from statements elicited by paper authors, and upon doing so we identified six practitioner interest groups, which you may have noticed appearing throughout the [VIS PDF and print program]((http://ieeevis.org/)):
