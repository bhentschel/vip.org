# ViP Workshop - Visualization Solutions in the Wild

The 2017 Workshop on Visualization in Practice (VIP) is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying the latest visualization and visual analytics research to real world problems. VIP targets work at the interface between visualization research and specific application domains. It is highly interdisciplinary and focused on delivering actual value to users. This year, we specifically focus on *visualization solutions in the wild*, i.e. on tools, systems, or frameworks which are actively used. The workshop will cover all aspects from their initial conception and design, the process of getting them into use, and the long-term work of extending and sustaining them.


## Monday, October 2; 2:00PM - 3:40 PM; 207 Lecture Hall
__Welcome!__ - Bernd Hentschel

__Keynote Address__ - _Exploranation_ 
: Anders Ynnerman, Linköping University
  
: _Abstract:_ This talk will take its starting point in the on-going convergence of exploratory and explanatory visualization paradigms. Based on the general availability of processing power, access to data and ever improving visualization methods, explanatory visualization can be data driven and fully interactive. This leads to a paradigm shift in visual learning and communication, enabling a new generation of installations and demonstrations at public venues such as, museums, planetariums and science centers. At the same time, explanatory methods can pave the path for new approaches to exploration and workflows for domain experts, and also improve internal team communication.  The talk will elaborate on how the cycle from exploratory to explanatory visualization can be closed, leading to notion of “exploranation”. Examples will be taken from a range of applications domains such as the volumetric rendering of exotic animals and mummies on touch tables as well as visualization of space exploration using the OpenSpace software in large scale dome theaters.
