# Visualization in Practice 2017 

The main goal of the Visualization in Practice Program is to facilitate a lively exchange between visualization practitioners and the visualization research community.

ViP integrates a variety of events. One of its main components is a half-day [workshop](workshop.html), which will be held on Monday, October 2nd 2017. It will focus on [interesting visualization solutions](call-for-participation.html) that have proven their value in real-life situations. ViP will also feature a [panel](panel.html), where panelists will talk about the impact of visualization research in their respective field of work. If you are a practitioner visiting the conference - potentially for the first time - have a look at our [pracititioner guide](http://ieeevis.org/year/2017/info/overview-amp-topics/practitioner-guide/pg) which may help you find your way around VIS. We are constantly updating this page with more information in the weeks leading up to IEEE VIS 2017. So please check back frequently. We are looking forward to meet you there.
