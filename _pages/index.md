ViP integrates a variety of events. One of its main components is a half-day [workshop](workshop), which will be held on Monday, October 2nd 2017. For that workshop we are [looking for](call-for-participation) interesting visualization solutions that have proven their value in real-life situations. ViP will also feature a [panel](panel), where experts from industry will discuss the impact of newly introduced visualization methods on their work. More information for practitioners visiting the conference - potentially for the first time - will be made available on this web site in the time leading up to IEEE VIS 2017. We are looking forward to meet you there.
