<!-- # Visualization in Practice 2018  -->

The **VisInPractice** program at **[IEEE VIS](http://ieeevis.org)** is an opportunity for visualization practitioners and researchers to meet and share experiences, insights, and ideas in applying visualization and visual analytics to real-world use cases. VisInPractice seeks to acknowledge successful transfers of visualization research into applications as well as current visualization practices occurring in industry.

The [VisInPractice 2018 Program](program.html) will feature a full day of presentations of real world visualization and visual analytics projects on **Monday, October 22nd, 2018**. It will also include a fast-paced, single-session mini-symposium on the practical aspects of uncertainty visualization; see the [Call for Participation](cfp.html) for more information.

We will be constantly updating this page with more information in the weeks leading up to IEEE VIS 2018, so please check back frequently. We are looking forward to meet you there.
