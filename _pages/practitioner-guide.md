# A Practitioner's Guide to VIS'17

## What is IEEE VIS? 

IEEE VIS 2017 provides the premier forum for advances in scientific and information visualization in academia, science, government, and industry. A full complement of research presentations, tutorials, symposiums, workshops, panels, demonstrations, posters, and exhibitions make this conference one of the largest and most important gatherings of researchers and professionals who specialize in the visual analysis of data.


## Why should I attend IEEE VIS 2017?

* Meet over 1,000 conference participants – potential customers and collaborators – leading researchers from government, industry, and academia from around the world that specialize in visual data representation and analysis.

* Get to know cutting edge research and trends in visual data representation and analysis.

* Improve your knowledge and skills in visual data representation and analysis by attending tutorials given by renown scientists and practitioners in the field.

* All tutorials, workshops, and co-located symposia are included in the registration fee of the conference and come at no additional cost! 

* IEEE VIS and its co-located, associated events cover a broad range of visualization topics e.g.
  * The integration of visualization techniques with machine learning methods
  * Scalable approaches for large and big data visualization
  * Human factors in (visual) data analysis 
  * Most recent research results in how to design effective visualizations
  * Application examples from a wide range of domains
  * Solutions for visualization challenges 
  * Future interaction and visualization technologies like immersive analytics
  
  
## Highlighted events for practitioners at IEEE VIS 2017 

IEEE VIS is known as the major research conference in the field of visual data analysis. Yet, the conference is not only interesting for researchers but comes with many events that are interesting for practitioners as well. On Sunday and Monday you can choose among 9 different tutorials, 11 workshop and two co-located symposia, some of which are highlighted below. The main conference takes place Tuesday to Friday with four parallel sessions featuring talks on the latest research results in the field as well as panel discussions and the supporters exhibition. 
And best of all, all these events are included in the regular registration fee! No pre-registration for single events is required but you can select the sessions you want to attend on the fly as you like while you are at VIS. 

To give you an idea what you are going to miss if you don’t attend, here is a list of selected events that are of special interest for practitioners.
