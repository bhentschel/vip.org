<h2 id="highlighted-events-for-practitioners-at-ieee-vis-2017">Highlighted events for practitioners at IEEE VIS 2017</h2>

<p>IEEE VIS is known as the major research conference in the field of visual data analysis. Yet, the conference is not only interesting for researchers but comes with many events that are interesting for practitioners as well. On Sunday and Monday you can choose among 9 different tutorials, 11 workshop and two co-located symposia, some of which are highlighted below. The main conference takes place Tuesday to Friday with four parallel sessions featuring talks on the latest research results in the field as well as panel discussions and the supporters exhibition. 
And best of all, all these events are included in the regular registration fee! No pre-registration for single events is required but you can select the sessions you want to attend on the fly as you like while you are at VIS.</p>

<p>To give you an idea what you are going to miss if you don’t attend, here is a list of selected events that are of special interest for practitioners.
